LaughALot is a Generative AI Powered joke generator. Users can enter topics or leave the field blank to get a joke about a topic or just a general joke. This is done by a ternary GET or POST request to the OpenAI API for the GPT-4o foundational model. The API is stateless and was tested using Postman. Model parameters for temprature, top_k, top_p, and maxtokens are configured for optimal responses in the context of jokes. Clerk authentication supports users to log in using email or identity federation via gmail. Utilized Vercel to integrate CI/CD from Github actions and host serverless.
